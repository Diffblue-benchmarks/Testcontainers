# mongo-singleton-container-demo

The singleton container is started only once when the base class is loaded. The container can then be used by all inheriting test classes. This application gives you an example of how to use it.

## Running the tests

Just run `UserControllerTest` and `UserRepositoryTest` as a standard JUnit test case.
